# Project overview

Goal: a native macOS GLM-OCR experience that is:

- lightweight (no CPython),
- offline-first (model cached locally after initial download),
- architecturally future-proof (core + adapter),
- UI-friendly (streaming, cancellation, job queue).

This repo starts with scaffolding and deliberately stubs the GLM-OCR model port so you can land architecture first.
