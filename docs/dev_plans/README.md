# Development plans

**Status (2026-02-17):** active — current work is tracked via per-topic trackers; completed early phases live under `docs/dev_plans/archive/`.

## Active trackers
- Quality/parity validation: `docs/dev_plans/quality_parity/tracker.md`
- GUI polish + distribution: `docs/dev_plans/gui_polish_distribution/tracker.md`

## Completed trackers (kept for reference)
- Multi-page PDFs: `docs/dev_plans/multi_page_pdf/tracker.md`

## Archive (completed phases)
- Phase 00 (scaffold): `docs/dev_plans/archive/00_scaffold.md`
- Phase 01 (ModelStore): `docs/dev_plans/archive/01_modelstore.md`
- Phase 02 (model port): `docs/dev_plans/archive/02_model_port.md`
- Phase 03 (single image / single PDF page): `docs/dev_plans/archive/03_mvp_single_image.md`
- Phase 04 (layout + region OCR): `docs/dev_plans/archive/04_layout_stage.md`

## Conventions
- Every plan/tracker starts with an **Objective** and a dated **Status** line.
- Prefer adding new work as a new folder with a `tracker.md` (instead of rewriting archived phase docs).
