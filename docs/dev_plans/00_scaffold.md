# Phase 00 — Scaffold (this repo)

**Objective:** establish project boundaries + buildable targets + docs.

Borrowing references: `docs/reference_projects.md` (survey + borrowing map) to keep later phases grounded.

## Done in this starter
- [x] SwiftPM package with `VLMRuntimeKit`, `GLMOCRAdapter`, `GLMOCRApp`, `GLMOCRCLI`
- [x] AGENTS.md
- [x] docs layout + initial plans

## Exit criteria
- `swift build` succeeds on macOS 14+ with Xcode/Swift 6
- `swift test` succeeds
- CLI launches and prints usage
- App launches (UI only; model path unresolved)
