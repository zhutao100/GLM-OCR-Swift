In this report, we share our key findings in the development of the reasoning-centric training framework. We first develop a capable vision foundation model with significant potential through large-scale pre-training, which arguably sets the upper bound for the final performance. We then propose Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Sampling (RLCS) to unlock the full potential of the model, leading to comprehensive capability enhancement across a diverse range of tasks, including STEM problem solving, video understanding, content recognition, coding, grounding, GUI-based agents, and long document interpretation. In a comprehensive evaluation across 42 public benchmarks, GLM-4.5V achieves state-of-the-art performance on nearly all tasks among open-source models of similar size, and demonstrates competitive or even superior results compared to closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Flash on challenging tasks including Coding and GUI Agents. Meanwhile, the smaller GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking remains highly competitive—achieving superior results to the much larger Qwen2.5-VL-72B on 29 benchmarks. We open-source both GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking and GLM-4.5V. Code, models and more information are released at https://github.com/zai-org/ GLM-V",

Over the past decade, as the intelligence level of models has advanced dramatically [36; 47; 20; 4], the complexity of corresponding multimodal intelligence tasks has increased accordingly. From solving scientific problems [67; 32; 34] to developing autonomous agents [21; 62; 43], the demands on VLMs have far surpassed simple visual content perception [31], with an increasing emphasis on advanced reasoning abilities. Recently, numerous studies have shown that long-form reasoning [60] and scalable reinforcement learning [42] can significantly enhance the ability of large language models (LLMs) to solve complex problems [23; 17]. Several previous works have attempted to enhance the reasoning capabilities of VLMs using similar paradigms [46; 33], but they mainly focus on specific domains. The open-source community currently also lacks a multimodal reasoning model that consistently outperforms traditional non-thinking models of comparable parameter scale across a broad range of scenarios and tasks.",

Our training framework is structured around a unified objective: to comprehensively enhance the model's reasoning capabilities through scalable reinforcement learning. For pre-training, we curate a broad and diverse corpus of knowledge-intensive multimodal data to equip the model with strong foundational capabilities, including (a) massive image-text pairs with accurate factual knowledge; (b) a self-curated academic corpus with interleaved image and text; (c) annotated documents and diagrams, instructional videos, and grounding data spanning both natural and synthetic images. This foundation model serves as a high-potential multimodal reasoning base for subsequent reinforcement learning. In the supervised fine-tuning phase, we construct carefully designed, domain-specific datasets that teach the model to perform effective reasoning with a standardized format across a wide range of tasks. Finally, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Sampling (RLCS) to drive large-scale, cross-domain reasoning capabilities. RLCS is a multi-domain reinforcement learning framework that combines curriculum learning with difficulty-aware sampling to improve training efficiency by selecting tasks and samples suited to the model's current competence. Our reinforcement learning process enhances training effectiveness and stability, and systematically improves the model's reasoning abilities through interaction and feedback across diverse domains.",
