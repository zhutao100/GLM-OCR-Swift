- Ends with text line "model’s performance, with gains of up to +10.6% when experimented with GLM-4.5V."
  - `’` can be `'` or similar markers.

## Page 2
- Starts with header line "1 Introduction"
- Ends with text line "performance. Therefore, we propose strategies including Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum"

## Page 3
- Starts with text lines "Sampling (RLCS) and dynamic sampling expansion via ratio-based Exponential Moving Average" and "(EMA). (See Section 5.3)"
- Ends with text lines "temporal distances between frames, thereby boosting its temporal understanding and grounding" and "capabilities."
